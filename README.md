# Find an address plugin for the GOV.UK Prototype Kit

A basic address finder plugin for use with the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/).

This plugin allows you to insert the full [DWP Find an address pattern](https://design-system.dwp.gov.uk/patterns/find-an-address) into a prototype without having to code individual pages or routes. It includes pages, routes and logic for storing an address in the prototype session.

## Requirements

To use this plugin you will need the GOV.UK Prototype Kit version 13 or later.

You will need to add an API key to your prototype. For prototyping purposes the plugin uses the [Ordnance Survey Place API](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/places/overview): DWP production services should use the DWP Address Service instead.

1. Request an API key by emailing the Design System Team on [dwp-design-system@engineering.digital.dwp.gov.uk](mailto:dwp-design-system@engineering.digital.dwp.gov.uk).

2. To make your prototype work locally, add the API key to the `.env` file in your prototype like so: `OS_API_KEY=your-api-key`. If your prototype doesn't have a `.env` file, create one that just contains this text and save it in the prototype's root folder.

>[!CAUTION]
>To avoid publishing API keys to a public repository, your `.env` file must remain local and should never be included in any commit.

3. To deploy the key to your published prototype, set `OS_API_KEY` as an environment variable on your hosting service. The way this works will depend on your hosting service: on Heroku you can [use the command line, the dashboard or the platform API](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#managing-config-vars).

## Using the plugin with the GOV.UK Prototype Kit

These instructions assume you have already started a prototype by installing the GOV.UK Prototype Kit. If not, do that first.

### 1. Install the plugin

In the folder that contains your prototype, install the plugin by running the following terminal command:

`npm i https://github.com/dwp/find-an-address-plugin.git`

### 2. Add the following code to your prototype's `app/routes.js` file

```

const findAddressPlugin = require("find-an-address-plugin");

findAddressPlugin(router);
```

### 3. Add the Find an address pattern to your prototype

Link to the plugin from any page in your prototype as shown below. In this example the link is a "Continue" button.

```

{# Example of a Continue button #}
{{
    govukButton({
        text: "Continue",
        href: "/dwp-find-an-address-plugin/start?find_an_address_exit_url=/your-exit-url",
        isStartButton: false
    })
}}
```

This link also controls what happens after the user successfully confirms an address. Replace `/your-exit-url` with the URL of the page that should appear after the address confirmation page.

(See [Use links to set data](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/pass-data#use-links-to-set-data) for more about how this works.)

### 4. Use the stored address elsewhere in your prototype

The confirmed address is stored in the prototype session with an object called `address`. You can access it in the [same way you do for other session data](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/session#accessing-fields-from-the-session), using `{{ data.address }}` or `{{ data['address'] }}`.

The stored address will be cleared (along with any other stored session data) by the "Clear data" link in the prototype footer.
